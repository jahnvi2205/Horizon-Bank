    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Decades before, most of the banks used to maintain the details of their customers in a record book or in an excel sheet in a computer. This is not so reliable as compared to today’s revolutionary growth of technology in almost all of the fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a negative side in today’s growth of technology i.e. the increasing cyber crimes all over the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know, in earlier days we need to stand in a long queue for hours in banks to deposit (a sum of money paid into a bank account) or withdraw (a sum of money withdrawn from a bank account) or to create a new bank account?\n",
    "But nowadays with the growth of technology, users can create and maintain their bank account or pay their electric bills, phone bills by sitting in their homes. All they need is a smartphone and internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a new bank called Horizon Bank decides to update their banking model from old excel sheets to the latest technology and require a sample project of a bank model. Let us help them in creating this bank application."

    "2. Allow an existing customer of the bank to\n",
